# SAC-ANTI-CHEAT


## FEATURES:

**heavy HEAVY anti remote event manipulation.**
1st layer = blank remote event names
2nd layer = faux remote events that kick the player (ofc they are all blank so it makes it hard to see)
3rd layer = random number of remote events added before the real ones, to prevent table indexing.
4th layer = executing remote events randomly to throw off additional exploiters using remotespy.

**Body mover detection!**
*anti fly, anti anti-speed bypass, other bodymover stuff.*

**Anti walkspeed / JumpPower!**

**anti jump!**

**anti teleport!**

**anti esp!** 
*not that it would be usefull in the game anyways*

**anti noclip!** 
*most noclip is via Humanoid:ChangeState()*

## INFO:
There is **always** a way to manipulate the remotes, but *hopefully* theres enough layers to make it too much of a task / *annoying* to exploit on the game, 
and prevent exploits to be made and released. if you ***WANTED*** to, you could index all of the remotes and then just through a task of elimination 
**randomly** guess and you *might* get the right remote that you were hoping for, but if you join a different server, the remotes are different. 
__*it really just is a speedbump.*__

**BUT**, with the **HEAVY** anti remote manipulation, that means that aimbot is ***NEARLY*** 100% **patched**. since *most* aimbots / kill alls are from manipulating remote events, its just *not worth* an exploiters time to write out a bunch of code, that only works once.
